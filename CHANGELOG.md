From this version on, `cockpit` will be available as `cockpit-for-pytorch` on
PyPI.

### Added
- Make library `pip`-installable as `cockpit-for-pytorch`
  [[PR](https://github.com/f-dangel/cockpit/pull/17)]
- Require BackPACK main release
  [[PR](https://github.com/f-dangel/cockpit/pull/12)]
- Added a `savename` argument to the `CockpitPlotter.plot()` function, which lets you define the name, and now the `savedir` should really only describe the **directory**. [[PR](https://github.com/f-dangel/cockpit/pull/16), Fixes #8]
- Added optional `savefig_kwargs` argument to the `CockpitPlotter.plot()` function that gets passed to the `matplotlib` function `fig.savefig()` to, e.g., specify DPI value or use a different file format (e.g. PDF). [[PR](https://github.com/f-dangel/cockpit/pull/16), Fixes #10]

### Internal
