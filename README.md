# Project "BackBoard" (in the spirit of tensorboard)

Idea: Use BackPACK to monitor quantities during training to tell the "pilot"
(person sitting in front of the computer performing neural network training)
what the "cockpit status of the airplane" is like.

## Getting started with Anaconda

* Set up the `conda` environment named `backboard`
  
```bash
conda env create -f .conda_env.yml
```

* Activate by
  
```bash
conda activate backboard
```

## Getting started with pre-commit hooks

pre-commit install
```
