"""Tests for ``cockpit.quantities.inner_product_test.py``.

Note: The inner product test seems to always pass in the first iterations
on mnist_logreg and fmnist_2c2d. Also, it suggests extremely small batch size.
I first thought there must be an error, but after a double check I could not
find anything. It seems that in the beginning of optimization, the gradients
are well-behaved.

Note: Similar to the norm test, the two tested ways to compute the inner product
    test deviate quite a lot numerically (only first three digits match when running
    on a CPU. The precision varies with hardware).
